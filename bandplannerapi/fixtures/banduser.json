            "bio": "With Heaven Honey, Jordan Victoria achieves a balance between simplicity and depth indicative of her ever shifting creative interests. From synth infused, down beat pop songs to angular guitar enmeshed rock, Victoria commands a musical left-of-center space that too few successfully inhabit. With releases “Tomorrow I’ll Try” and “Honeydew” Victoria burned brightly on the Nashville music radar and won widespread praise and support among her peers in the competitive Nashville community. At 26 years of age Victoria is in no rush to race fellow contemporaries to an imagined musical goal line; Heaven Honey is committed to steady, high caliber and thought provoking writing/production that holds more in its artistic content than a spot on a playlist.",
