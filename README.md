### Application Overview

Working as an independent musician can be very challenging, especially when you’re trying to focus on what, in theory, should matter the most - the music. Musicians or bands that function without a record label, manager, booking agent, and publicist often struggle to carry the weight of all of these responsibilities. My application, Bandplanner, aims to ease the burden of organizing and balancing these tasks so that musicians can spend more time focusing on their passion for music rather than getting hung up on the mundane aspects of the music business.
